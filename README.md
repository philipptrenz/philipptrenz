## Recent projects

Here comes a selection of my projects, I hope you like it!

### covidpass.eu 

![COVID Pass - just a click away in your iOS Apple Wallet](images/og-covidpass.jpg)

Together with UX designer [Donatus Wolf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donatuswolf/), I built [COVID Pass](https://github.com/philipptrenz/covidpass). Since July 2021, we have been running the webapp, which generates an Apple Wallet pass from the digital EU COVID certificate in a privacy-friendly way in the browser. This means that the vaccination, recovery or even test certificate is always at hand with a double tap on your iPhone and Apple Watch. So far (as of Oct 2021) we have already generated over 80,000 passes, for free of course!

Check it out @ [covidpass.eu](https://covidpass.eu/)



### melinamonks.de

![Melina Monks Open Graph Image](images/og-melinamonks.jpg)

Melina Monks accompanies people in body awareness, wish for children and birth support. Based on the corporate design by [Johanna Mellenthin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannamellenthin/), [Donatus Wolf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donatuswolf/) designed the website. And I finally implemented it as a statically generated page with [Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
