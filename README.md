## Recent projects

### covidpass.eu 

![COVID Pass - just a click away in your iOS Apple Wallet](images/og-covidpass.jpg)

Together with UX designer [Donatus Wolf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donatuswolf/), I built [COVID Pass](https://github.com/philipptrenz/covidpass). Since July 2021, we have been running the webapp, which generates an Apple Wallet pass from the digital EU COVID certificate in a privacy-friendly way in the browser. This means that the vaccination, recovery or even test certificate is always at hand with a double tap on your iPhone and Apple Watch. So far (as of Oct 2021) we have already generated over 80,000 passes, for free of course!

Check it out @ [covidpass.eu](https://covidpass.eu/)



### podcast2phone.de

![podcast2phone - digitization without losses](images/og-podcast2phone.jpg)

podcast2phone offers podcast producers and media houses the possibility to offer their audio on demand content to people who have limited or no access to digital services. With this cloud software, podcasts and individual audio episodes can be conveniently connected to our cloud telephone infrastructure via a web interface. Set up in just a few minutes your audio content, otherwise only available digitally, can now be listened to on the probably most common audio device: The phone.

The project was developed together with UX designers [Marius Classen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claßen/) and [Donatus Wolf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donatuswolf/).



### melinamonks.de

![Melina Monks Open Graph Image](images/og-melinamonks.jpg)

Melina Monks accompanies people in body awareness, wish for children and birth support. Based on the corporate design by [Johanna Mellenthin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannamellenthin/), [Donatus Wolf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donatuswolf/) designed the website. And I finally implemented it as a statically generated page with [Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
