## Recent projects

### covidpass.eu 

![COVID Pass - just a click away in your iOS Apple Wallet](images/og-covidpass.jpg)

Together with UX designer [Donatus Wolf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donatuswolf/), I built [COVID Pass](https://github.com/philipptrenz/covidpass). Since July 2021, we have been running the webapp, which generates an Apple Wallet pass from the digital EU COVID certificate in a privacy-friendly way in the browser. This means that the vaccination, recovery or even test certificate is always at hand with a double tap on your iPhone and Apple Watch. So far (as of Oct 2021) we have already generated over 80,000 passes, for free of course!

### podcast2phone.de

![podcast2phone - digitization without losses](images/og-podcast2phone.jpg)

podcast2phone enables podcast producers and media houses to offer their audio on demand content to people who have limited or no access to digital services. With this cloud software, podcasts and individual audio episodes can be conveniently connected to our cloud telephone infrastructure via a web interface. Set up in just a few minutes your audio content, otherwise only available digitally, can now be listened to on the probably most common audio device: The phone.

The project was developed together with UX designers [Marius Classen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claßen/) and [Donatus Wolf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donatuswolf/).

Her clients include [The Female Company](https://www.thefemalecompany.com), [Nivea](https://www.nivea.com) and [klaeny](http://klaeny.de).

Melina Monks accompanies people in body awareness, wish for children and birth support. [Johanna Mellenthin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannamellenthin/) created the corporate design for her and [Donatus Wolf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donatuswolf/) did the web design. Based on that I implemented a statically generated page using [Nuxt.js](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) and [tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss).
