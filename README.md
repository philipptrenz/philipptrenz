## Current projects

### covidpass.eu 

Together with UX designer [Donatus Wolf](), I built [COVID Pass](https://github.com/philipptrenz/covidpass). Since July 2021, we have been running the webapp, which generates an Apple Wallet pass from the digital EU COVID certificate in a privacy-friendly way in the browser. This means that the vaccination, recovery or even test certificate is always at hand with a double tap on your iPhone and Apple Watch. So far (as of Oct 2021) we have already generated over 80,000 passes, for free of course!
